Helm with Nginx Ingress Controller for Kubernetes Deployment:-
--------------------------------------------------------------
Using Helm to manage the Nginx Ingress Controller simplifies the process of deploying applications in Kubernetes that require external access. Below is an explanation and a step-by-step guide to deploying an application using Helm and the Nginx Ingress Controller.

What is Helm?
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you deploy, manage, and upgrade applications in the form of "charts." Charts are pre-configured Kubernetes resources that make deployments consistent and reusable.

What is an Nginx Ingress Controller?
The Nginx Ingress Controller is a Kubernetes resource that manages HTTP and HTTPS traffic routing to applications running inside the cluster. It exposes applications to external traffic via an Ingress resource.

Steps to Deploy an Application with Helm and Nginx Ingress Controller
1. Install Helm
Ensure Helm is installed on your system. You can install it with the following:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
Verify installation:

bash
Copy
Edit
helm version
2. Add the Nginx Ingress Helm Repository
The official Nginx Ingress Helm chart is available in the kubernetes-ingress repository.

bash
Copy
Edit
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
helm repo update
3. Deploy the Nginx Ingress Controller
Run the following command to deploy the Nginx Ingress Controller:

bash
Copy
Edit
helm install nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace
This command:

Installs the Nginx Ingress Controller in a new namespace called ingress-nginx.
Fetches the default configuration from the Helm repository.
Verify the deployment:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
4. Create a Kubernetes Application Deployment
Deploy your application using a Kubernetes deployment. Below is an example YAML file for an application named my-app:

yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
Apply the deployment:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
5. Expose the Application Using a Service
Create a Service to expose the application's pods internally in the cluster:

yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
Apply the Service:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
6. Create an Ingress Resource
The Ingress resource directs external traffic to the Service. Below is an example:

yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-app-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host: my-app.local
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-app-service
            port:
              number: 80
Apply the Ingress resource:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
7. Access the Application
Add an entry to your /etc/hosts file for the domain (my-app.local) pointing to your cluster's external IP.
Find the external IP of the Nginx Ingress Controller:
bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx
Access the application in your browser at http://my-app.local.

Benefits of Using Helm and Nginx Ingress
Simplified Configuration: Helm charts provide reusable and version-controlled templates.
Scalability: Ingress rules handle traffic for multiple applications efficiently.
Customizability: Helm values can be overridden to fine-tune configurations.
